# JMU-metadev.Excel2MARCXML
The scripts were developed to fast-track the creation of MARC records from ETD (electronic thesis and dissertation) files that are generated by the James Madison University institutional repository, JMU Scholarly Commons, hosted by bepress.  The XSLTs require a simple, schema-less XML document with the Excel headers used as element tags.  This step is accomplished by first saving the Excel in "Excel 2003 XML Spreadsheet" format, then transforming it with Excel2NamedXML.xsl, a link to which is posted within my scripts.  NamedXML2MARC_BIB.xsl will generate a MARC XML collection of bibliographic records from an Excel2NamedXML file.  NamedXML2MARC_AUTHORITY.xsl generates NACO records from the dissertant names.  These scripts are released under a CC-By-NC 4.0 license.
